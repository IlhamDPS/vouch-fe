# Answer from the question

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Date Submission

11 September 2023

## Instructions to run assignment locally

I have not experience on setup docker. So i will write manually to run this

just write npm start on terminal on this folder, and it will run the application on http://localhost:3000

## Time spent

I spent 6 hours to build this (FE and BE), and before building, I searched for the technology needed to solve the problem, and it takes 1 hour i think to find the tech that need.

## Assumptions made

In my opinion, this is a website that provides a private room so two users can chat.

## Shortcuts/Compromises made


So there is something that maybe can make the development process faster, like implementing a CSS library, setting the boilerplate, etc. So when there is another feature or change, it can be more efficient.  

## What would be your approach to ensuring the application is ready for production (testing)?

When launching a new product, feature, or even some changes to production, ideally the team should have a SOP, like first the code has to be reviewed by someone, and then some testing has to be done, like system testing, unit testing, performance testing, stress testing, etc. But it depends on the team as to which testing should be implemented. 

## How would you ensure a smooth user experience as 1000â€™s of users start using your app simultaneously?

So there is some action that can be taken to make the app smooth even with thousands of users. Like database optimisation with indexing, connection pulling, etc., implement load balancing technology, and also, like my answer to the previous question, test the system in some scenarios to get feedback on what the team should improve from the system. 

## What key steps would you take to ensure application security?

So in my experience, there are some actions that you have to take to ensure security, like secure the coding practice, implement security testing, encrypt data if necessary, etc.

## What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about?

So there are some features that I'm not implementing in this solution, like online/offline, list rooms, sending media, and many more. The reason why I'm not able to do that is because I don't have enough time to work on this solution because, in my current company, I already have tonnes of work to do. So the best that I can do right now is implement the requirements of this test.

## Other information about your submission that you feel it's important that we know if applicable.

So I built this code from scratch without boilerplate or a css library, so it took me time to adjust the framework and css (because I am bad at css). This website also uses a websocket to handle real-time chat, and it's my first time setting up the websocket, so it also takes time to learn and try to fix the tech.

## Your feedback on this technical challenge

Nope, there isn't any feedback from me.
